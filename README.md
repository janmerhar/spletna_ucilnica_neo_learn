## Introduction

"Spletna U훾ilnica Neo Learn" is a web-based learning platform designed to facilitate online education. The platform offers a range of features to enhance the learning experience for both educators and students.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP
- Composer
- Node.js

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janmerhar/spletna_ucilnica_neo_learn.git
   ```

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd spletna_ucilnica_neo_learn
   ```

1. **Install PHP Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd php
   composer install
   ```

1. **Install JavaScript Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd src
   npm install
   ```

1. **Compile the Vue App**:
   Vue uses a build system to compile the app into static assets that can be served by any web server. To compile and minify the app for production, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will create a `dist/` directory containing the compiled assets.

1. **Run the SQL Script**:
   Execute the SQL script located in `_SQL/learn.sql` to set up the database.

1. **Configure the Database Connection**:
   Update the database connection details in `php/libraries/dbconnect.php`.

1. **Start the Application**:
   Depending on your setup, you can use a local server or a dedicated server to serve the application. Ensure that the server points to the dist/ directory (or wherever your compiled assets are located) for the frontend and appropriately routes API requests to the PHP backend.
